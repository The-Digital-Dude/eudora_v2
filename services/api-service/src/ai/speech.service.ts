 * ElevenLabs plan, which allows 10,000 characters a month. A single full story
 * is roughly that on its own, so the quota running out is the expected case,
 * not a failure to handle someday. When it does, synthesis falls back to the
 * model provider's slower TTS: the voice changes and a line takes ten seconds
 * or so instead of one, which is bad, but a public demo that keeps talking in
 * a worse voice beats one that stops talking.
